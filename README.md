# React Portfolio (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is a frontend-only React portfolio scaffold built with Vite and Tailwind CSS. It's intentionally modular so you can edit `src/data/profile.js` to update your information.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# 1) Install dependencies
npm install

# 2) Run dev server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser (Vite prints the exact URL).

Files to edit with your info:

- `src/data/profile.js` — update name, summary, experience, education, links, etc.
- `src/pages/*` or `src/components/*` — change layout and styling.

Notes:

- Contact form is a demo (no backend). Replace submission logic with your email service or backend.
- The footer is visible on all pages via `src/components/Layout.jsx`.

If you want, I can now run `npm install` and start the dev server here to verify — say "Run it" and I'll proceed (network install required).
